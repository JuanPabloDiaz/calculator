# 25 + 5 Clock ⏰

This project is a responsive web application that allows users to use a pomodoro timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Thats why is called 25 + 5 clock

## Description 💡

This project is a 25 + 5 clock, which is a time management system that encourages people to work with the time they have—rather than against it. Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. These intervals are referred to as pomodoros.

This project was built as part of the **[freeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/1diazdev/front-end-development-libraries)**. The goal was to build a 25 + 5 clock with React.
